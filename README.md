# IoT Climate Control System: Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

This repository contains an analysis of IoT climate control data, including temperature, humidity, and soil nutrient levels, with a focus on predicting fan and watering pump activities. The project explores the relationship between environmental conditions and control system behavior, builds predictive models, and visualizes the results.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze the average temperature and humidity when the fan is ON.
- Understand the total watering pump activity and its relationship with soil nutrients.
- Visualize hourly fan and watering pump activity.
- Build predictive models for efficient watering pump control using machine learning.
- Compare temperature and humidity between day and night.

## Files in the Repository

- **IoTProcessed_Data.csv**: The dataset containing the climate control data, including temperature, humidity, soil nutrients (N, P, K), fan status, and watering pump status.
- **IoT_Climate_Control_Presentation.pptx**: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the findings, visualizations, and predictive models used in the project.
-  **Jupyter_Notebook_Climate_Analysis.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing the code used for climate data analysis.
- **README.md**: The readme file providing an overview of the project and instructions for setup.
